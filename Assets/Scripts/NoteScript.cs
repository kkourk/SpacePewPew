     * Currently there is an issues with 2d and 3d collision, capsules are using 3d rigidbodies the projectiles use 2d,
     *  these cannot collide or use any other physics against each other thus i have changed the projectile to 3d for the momment.
     * 
     * There might be some errors with the movement of the player model, this will be clear wether or not this is the case when we get a new player model
